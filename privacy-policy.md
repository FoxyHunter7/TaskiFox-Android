# Privacy Policy

## Introduction
This Privacy Policy explains how TaskiFox for android collects, uses, and protects your information when you use the app.

## Data Collection
- **User Data**: All to-do items, projects, and any other data you input into the app are stored locally on your device. This data is not transmitted to any external servers.
- **API Keys**: If you enter an API key for the OpenWeatherMap API, it will be stored securely using encrypted shared preferences on your device. This key is used exclusively to fetch weather data and is not shared with any external parties.
- **Location Data**: If you allow the app location permissions it will only collect and store your location when you tell the app to; e.g. if you wish to auto-fill country-code and city with location in the settings. This data is not transmitted to any external server.

**Data Usage**
The data TaskiFox collects is used solely for the purpose of showing you the data (e.g. todos, projects, ...) that you entered as well as showing relevant weather information should you have enabled that in the settings.

**User Rights**
- **Access**: You can view and manage all information you entered yourself through the app (e.g. todos, projects, ..), this includes the openweathermapapi key _should you have enetered one_ and the geocgraphic information obtained by location or manually entered
- **Deletion**: You can delete any information at anytime
- **Opt-Out**: You can opt-out of data collection by not entering anything into the app.

**Data Security**
TaskiFox implements appropriate security measures to protect your data, including using encrypted shared preferences for storing your API key.

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
