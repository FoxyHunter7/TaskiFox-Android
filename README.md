TaskiFox is a to-do / agenda app that is aimed to be simple to use whilst being as powerful as possible. You can add or remove to-dos, each to-do consisting of a title, description and due date _(time)_. You're also given projects which you can give a name, description and colour to help you keep things organised.

## Features
- See your todo in a clean & simple overview screen
- set reminder notififcations
- Organise your todos in projects _(projects have their own color)_
- Keep a history of tasks
  - _Configurable in settings_
- Show weather prediction next to days in main screen
  - _Using openweathermapapi, can be turned on in settings but needs api-keu (of free version)_
